  abstract = {The use of scenarios to evaluate restoration effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) is fundamental to improve restoration practices. Here we developed a systematic review to verify the existence of gaps and limitations in the use of scenarios for environmental restoration, and assess the state of the science of ``restoration scenarios'' and implications for future research. From 419 studies reviewed, most were held in developed countries, using exploratory scenarios at the regional scale, actively restoring ES and habitat at ``habitat, ecosystems or communities'' at landscape level, targeting forests and fragmented landscapes. The main gaps we identified were: few studies in tropical, marine, and urban environments, despite their importance for biodiversity and ES; few reports on global scales using target-seeking approach, despite the existence of global targets; small number of studies considered invertebrates and invasive species, neglecting many ecosystem services and disservices; lack of participatory and cost-effectiveness studies, revealing a disconnection between restoration research and socioeconomic context. The gaps identified might prevent the widespread use of scenarios for restoration planning, particularly the limited scales of analysis, the lack of participatory approaches, and weak cost consideration. We encourage the use of target-seeking scenarios, with clear objectives, stimulating collaboration among stakeholders seeking cost-effective restoration alternatives.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have shown reduced performance in plants that are surrounded by neighbours of the same species1,2, a phenomenon known as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD)3. A long-held ecological hypothesis posits that CNDD is more pronounced in tropical than in temperate forests4,5, which increases community stabilization, species coexistence and the diversity of local tree species6,7. Previous analyses supporting such a latitudinal gradient in CNDD8,9 have suffered from methodological limitations related to the use of static data10--12. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of latitudinal CNDD patterns using dynamic mortality data to estimate species-site-specific CNDD across 23 sites. Averaged across species, we found that stabilizing CNDD was present at all except one site, but that average stabilizing~CNDD was not stronger toward the tropics. However, in tropical tree communities, rare and intermediate abundant species experienced stronger stabilizing CNDD than did common species. This pattern was absent in temperate forests, which suggests that CNDD influences species abundances more strongly in tropical forests than it does in temperate ones13. We also found that interspecific variation in CNDD, which might attenuate its stabilizing effect on species diversity14,15, was high but not significantly different across latitudes. Although the consequences of these patterns for latitudinal diversity gradients are difficult to evaluate, we speculate that a more effective regulation of population abundances could translate into greater stabilization of tropical tree communities and thus contribute to the high local diversity of tropical forests.},

  abstract = {There is good evidence that the results of a restoration program depend largely on the landscape context such as habitat cover, connectivity and isolation. Such evidence, however, is not coherently presented in the scientific literature. This review aims to provide an overview of how landscape ecology has been used in restoration projects in the last 15 years. We found only 54 empirical restoration studies published in international journals from 1997 to 2011 that used a landscape approach, mostly published between 2009 and 2011. The majority of the studies were carried out in temperate zones and forests, with habitat loss and fragmentation as the major disturbance factor (77\%). Biotic manipulation was the most common management protocol (39\%), followed by abiotic manipulation, land abandonment, and control of disturbance sources. Most of the studies (84\%) demonstrate that the landscape context plays an important role in restoration processes. Particularly, a positive influence of the landscape context on restoration effectiveness was observed for restored areas in close proximity to neighboring patches and in landscapes with high habitat cover. However, we found that the effect of landscape characteristics on restoration outcomes may vary with species characteristics, and differ according to the population or community parameters (e.g. abundance, richness, composition) considered. In addition, different landscape aspects mediated the effects of restoration on biological communities, and thus there is not a unique set of landscape indices that can be universally used for restoration planning and monitoring. Although the literature has important gaps, since most studies are restricted to few habitat and disturbance types and consider only a limited set of landscape attributes, our findings demonstrate that landscape characteristics can be as important as local factors in influencing restoration outcomes and should be incorporated in restoration projects and programmes. By considering a wide range of landscape resilience and disturbance condition since the beginning of future restoration plans, we expect that the main gaps of knowledge identified here can be filled in the near future, helping then to reveal a more general pattern relating landscape structure to restoration outcomes},

  abstract = {The future trajectory of global forests is closely intertwined with tree demography, and a major fundamental goal in ecology is to understand the key mechanisms governing spatio-temporal patterns in tree population dynamics. While previous research has made substantial progress in identifying the mechanisms individually, their relative importance among forests remains unclear mainly due to practical limitations. One approach to overcome these limitations is to group mechanisms according to their shared effects on the variability of tree vital rates and quantify patterns therein. We developed a conceptual and statistical framework (variance partitioning of Bayesian multilevel models) that attributes the variability in tree growth, mortality, and recruitment to variation in species, space, and time, and their interactions -- categories we refer to as organising principles (OPs). We applied the framework to data from 21 forest plots covering more than 2.9 million trees of approximately 6500 species. We found that differences among species, the species OP, proved a major source of variability in tree vital rates, explaining 28--33\% of demographic variance alone, and 14--17\% in interaction with space, totalling 40--43\%. Our results support the hypothesis that the range of vital rates is similar across global forests. However, the average variability among species declined with species richness, indicating that diverse forests featured smaller interspecific differences in vital rates. Moreover, decomposing the variance in vital rates into the proposed OPs showed the importance of unexplained variability, which includes individual variation, in tree demography. A focus on how demographic variance is organized in forests can facilitate the construction of more targeted models with clearer expectations of which covariates might drive a vital rate. This study therefore highlights the most promising avenues for future research, both in terms of understanding the relative contributions of groups of mechanisms to forest demography and diversity, and for improving projections of forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Habitat loss represents a major threat to biodiversity, however, the modulation of its effects by the nonhabitat matrix surrounding habitat patches is still undervalued. The landscape matrix might change community assembly in different ways. For example, low-quality matrices can accentuate environmental filtering by reducing resource availability and/or deteriorating abiotic conditions but they may also excessively limit dispersal of organisms and make communities more prone to ecological drift. To understand how matrix quality modulates the effects of habitat loss, we quantified the relative importance of environmental filter and ecological drift in bird communities across more local (400 m buffer around sampling sites) and broader (2 km focal landscapes) gradients of habitat loss embedded in low- and high-quality matrices. We used a trait-based approach to understand habitat loss filtering effects on occurrences of forest specialist and habitat generalist birds. We found that low-quality matrices, composed mainly of low-productive pasturelands, increased the severity of habitat loss filtering effects for forest specialist birds, but only at the landscape scale. Bird occurrences were in general higher in high-quality matrices, that is, more heterogeneous and with low-contrasting edges, indicating the role of the matrix quality in attenuating species extinction risks at the landscape scale, probably due to mass effect. Moreover, forest specialists presented a strong negative response to habitat loss filtering across different functional traits, while generalists presented a high variability in traits response to habitat loss. Synthesis and applications: We raised evidence in supporting that landscape habitat loss filtering may be relaxed or reinforced depending on the quality of the matrix, evidencing that matrix quality has a strong impact in modulating community assembly processes in fragmented landscapes. In practical terms, it means that improving matrix quality may help in maintaining the high diversity of birds even without any increase in native forest cover.},

More than one third of the farms does not have declared native vegetation and half of them have up to 3\% of native vegetation cover. Percentage of declared native vegetation cover tends to increase with farm size. However, only community lands and silviculture farms larger than 500 hectares showed most properties (more than 50\%) with at least 20\% of its area covered with native vegetation, as determined by the Brazilian Forest Act (federal law 12,651/2012).

It is considered rare, and it is reported on several regional conservation lists of species as either endangered or data deficient. Given its uniqueness and the poor knowledge of its ecology, we aimed to investigate home range size and overlap and habitat selection of the water opossum in Atlantic Forest streams in southeastern Brazil. We radio tracked water opossums and collected information about their habitats and behaviour from October 2004 to April 2010. We combined common home range estimators for animals living in linear habitats with the synoptic model of home range and habitat selection. For the 10 individuals monitored, the home ranges varied between 0.80 and 9.66 km of watercourses; none of them had exclusive home ranges. The home range size for males was, on average, three times larger than for females. The overlap data showed that, on average, one male could encompass the home ranges of up to five females simultaneously, but more than one male could have access to the same female. For habitat selection at the individual level, we could not find any strong influence of habitat features on water opossum preferences because individuals selected different sets of habitat variables. However, at the population level, we found a negative relationship between home range size and river size. The water opossum seems to prefer shallow and narrow watercourses to establish its home ranges. Here, we present valuable information to advance our knowledge of the water opossum and its ecology, which is urgent for conservation purposes.},

  abstract = {Forests are the largest terrestrial biomass pool, with over half of this biomass stored in the highly productive tropical lowland forests. The future evolution of forest biomass depends critically on the response of tree longevity and growth rates to future climate. We present an analysis of the variation in tree longevity and growth rate using tree-ring data of 3,343 populations and 438 tree species and assess how climate controls growth and tree longevity across world biomes. Tropical trees grow, on average, two times faster compared to trees from temperate and boreal biomes and live significantly shorter, on average (186 {\textpm} 138 y compared to 322 {\textpm} 201 y outside the tropics). At the global scale, growth rates and longevity covary strongly with temperature. Within the warm tropical lowlands, where broadleaf species dominate the vegetation, we find consistent decreases in tree longevity with increasing aridity, as well as a pronounced reduction in longevity above mean annual temperatures of 25.4 {$^\circ$}C. These independent effects of temperature and water availability on tree longevity in the tropics are consistent with theoretical predictions of increases in evaporative demands at the leaf level under a warmer and drier climate and could explain observed increases in tree mortality in tropical forests, including the Amazon, and shifts in forest composition in western Africa. Our results suggest that conditions supporting only lower tree longevity in the tropical lowlands are likely to expand under future drier and especially warmer climates.},

  abstract = {Biological data are often intrinsically hierarchical (e.g., species from different genera, plants within different mountain regions), which made mixed-effects models a common analysis tool in ecology and evolution because they can account for the non-independence. Many questions around their practical applications are solved but one is still debated: Should we treat a grouping variable with a low number of levels as a random or fixed effect? In such situations, the variance estimate of the random effect can be imprecise, but it is unknown if this affects statistical power and type I error rates of the fixed effects of interest. Here, we analyzed the consequences of treating a grouping variable with 2--8 levels as fixed or random effect in correctly specified and alternative models (under- or overparametrized models). We calculated type I error rates and statistical power for all-model specifications and quantified the influences of study design on these quantities. We found no influence of model choice on type I error rate and power on the population-level effect (slope) for random intercept-only models. However, with varying intercepts and slopes in the data-generating process, using a random slope and intercept model, and switching to a fixed-effects model, in case of a singular fit, avoids overconfidence in the results. Additionally, the number and difference between levels strongly influences power and type I error. We conclude that inferring the correct random-effect structure is of great importance to obtain correct type I error rates. We encourage to start with a mixed-effects model independent of the number of levels in the grouping variable and switch to a fixed-effects model only in case of a singular fit. With these recommendations, we allow for more informative choices about study design and data analysis and make ecological inference with mixed-effects models more robust for small number of levels.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the selection of resting sites occupied by the water opossum Chironectes minimus, between 2004 and 2010, in streams of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Fourteen radio-tracked adult (males and females) opossums used natural cavities as resting sites. Opossums selected narrow river stretches and selected their resting sites mainly according to characteristics favoring protection against adverse weather conditions. Likewise, opossums avoided disturbed habitats and established their resting sites in well-preserved riparian forest sites, selecting river sections containing a high density of trees and a high proportion of forest cover between the river banks and 50 m from the river. Besides increasing our knowledge on this species habitat selection, such findings further highlight this species' sensitivity to human disturbance.},
