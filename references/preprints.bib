  abstract = {Aim: Global forests and their structural and functional features are shaped by many mechanisms that impact tree vital rates. Although many studies have tried to quantify how specific mechanisms influence vital rates, their relative importance among forests remains unclear. We aimed to assess the patterns of variation in vital rates among species and in space and time across forests to understand and provide a baseline for expectations of the relative importance of the different mechanisms in different contexts. Location: 21 forest plots worldwide. Time period: 1981-2021 Major taxa studied: Woody plants Methods: We developed a conceptual and statistical framework (variance partitioning of multilevel models) that attributes the variability in growth, mortality, and recruitment to variation in species, space, and time, and their interactions, which we refer to as organising principles (OPs). We applied it to data from 21 forest plots covering more than 2.9 million trees of approximately 6,500 species. Results: Differences among species, the species OP, were a major source of variability in tree vital rates, explaining 28-33\% of demographic variance alone, and in interaction with space 14-17\%, totalling 40-43\%. Models with small spatial grain sizes (quadrats at 5 x 5 m) retained most of the spatial OP, but a large proportion of variance remained unexplained (31-55\%). The average variability among species declined with species richness across forests, indicating that diverse forests featured smaller interspecific differences in vital rates. Main conclusions: Decomposing variance in vital rates into the proposed OPs showed that taxonomy is crucial to predictions and understanding of tree demography. Our framework has a high potential for identifying the structuring mechanisms of global forest dynamics as it highlights the most promising avenues for future research both in terms of understanding the relative contributions of mechanisms to forest demography and diversity and for improving projections of forest ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation represent a major threat to biodiversity, however, the modulation of its effects by the non-habitat matrix surrounding habitat patches is still undervalued. The landscape matrix might change community assembly in different ways. For example, low-quality matrices can accentuate environmental filtering by reducing resource availability and/or deteriorating abiotic conditions but they may also over limit dispersal of organisms and make communities more prone to ecological drift. To understand how matrix quality modulates the effects of habitat loss, we quantified the relative importance of environmental filter and ecological drift in bird occurrences across both local and landscape gradients of habitat loss embedded in low- and high-quality matrices. We used a trait-based approach to understand habitat loss filtering effects on birds. We found that low-quality matrices, composed mainly of low-productive pasturelands, increased the severity of habitat loss filtering effects for forest specialist birds, but only at the landscape scale. Bird occurrence was in general higher in high-quality matrices, i.e., more heterogeneous and with low-contrasting edges, indicating the role of the matrix quality on attenuating species extinction risks at the landscape scale probably due to mass effect. Moreover, forest specialists presented a strong negative response to habitat loss filtering across different functional traits, while generalists presented a high variability in traits response to habitat loss. We raised evidence in supporting that landscape habitat loss filtering may be relaxed or reinforced depending on the quality of the matrix, evidencing that matrix quality has a strong impact in modulating community assembly processes in fragmented landscapes. In practical terms, it means that improving matrix quality may help in maintaining the high diversity of birds even without any increase in native forest cover.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Biological data are often intrinsically hierarchical. Due to their ability to account for such dependencies, mixed-effects models have become a common analysis technique in ecology and evolution. While many questions around their theoretical foundations and practical applications are solved, one fundamental question is still highly debated: When having a low number of levels should we model a grouping variable as a random or fixed effect? In such situation, the variance of the random effect is presumably underestimated, but whether this affects the statistical properties of the ecological effects (fixed effects) is unclear. Here, we analyzed the consequences of including a grouping variable as fixed or random effect and possible other modeling options (too simple or too complex models) for data with small number of levels in the grouping variable (2 - 8). For all models, we calculated type I error rates, power and coverage. Moreover, we show how these statistical properties change with the study design. We found that mixed-effects models already correctly estimate the variance of a random effect with only two groups. Moreover, model choice does not influence the statistical properties of the ecological effect when there is no random slope in the data-generating process. However, if an ecological effect differs among groups, using a random slope and intercept model, and switching to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit, avoids overconfidence in the results. Additionally, power and type I error are strongly influenced by the number of and difference between groups. We conclude that inferring the correct random effect structure is of high importance to get correct statistical properties. When in doubt, we recommend starting with the simpler model and using model diagnostics to identify missing components. When having identified the correct structure, we encourage to start with a mixed-effects model independent of the number of groups and switch to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit. With these recommendations, we allow for more informative choices about study design and data analysis and thus make ecological inference with mixed-effects models more robust for small number of groups.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
