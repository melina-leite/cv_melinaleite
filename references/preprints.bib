  abstract = {Although diverse perspectives are fundamental for fostering and advancing science, power relations have limited the development, propagation of ideas, and recognition of minority groups in academia. Gender bias is one of the most well-documented processes, leading women to drop out of their academic careers due to fewer opportunities and lower prestige. Using long-term data (2008-2019) on talks (n=344) from a seminar series in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology, we investigated the audience as a measure of women scientists' prestige. We questioned whether affirmative actions focused on increasing women's representation were enough to enhance women's visibility and recognition in science. Specifically, we evaluated (i) the strength of the leaky pipeline effect on the female representation as speakers and the effect of affirmative actions; (ii) whether the audience of the talk depends on the speaker's gender, even accounting for the speaker's career length and productivity (iii), and (iv) if there were gender differences in the topics of the talks. The results indicate that women gave fewer talks than men, and this difference was greater for seminars given by professors. However, affirmative action increased the representativeness of women throughout their career positions. Female speakers had smaller audiences, especially among professors, indicating higher prestige for male professors even with comparable productivity metrics. We found no gender effect in the research topics presented, indicating that the difference in audience may also not be related to the topics of the talks. We raise the discussion that gender bias in the academic community in attending talks may decrease the visibility of research carried out by women, potentially impacting professional development and restricting the visibility of ideas. Moreover, although encouraged, affirmative action increasing representativeness may not be enough against more subtle gender-stereotype biases. Our research contributes to the discussion of how gender inequity can influence visibility and reinforce the stigmatization of science.},

  abstract = {1. Underdispersion and overdispersion are common issues when analysing ecological data with generalised linear (mixed) models (GLMs/GLMMs). Overdispersion, the phenomenon where observations spread wider than expected by the fitted model, leads to anti-conservative p-values and, thus, to inflated type I error. In contrast, underdispersion, a narrower spread of the data than expected, causes overly conservative p-values and, therefore, a reduction in power. A range of tests has been suggested to detect such dispersion problems, but there are few comparative studies of their performance across a range of models and analysis situations. 2. The goal of this study is to identify a general dispersion test for GLMs/GLMMs that is applicable across all standard distributions and random-effects structures. After an initial assessment of available tests, we selected two classes of dispersion tests as candidates: (1) parametric and nonparametric tests based on Pearson residuals and (2) simulation-based tests that compare the expected to the observed variance in the response. 3. Comparing their performance by type I error, power, and dispersion estimate, across a range of GLMs and GLMMs, we find that a nonparametric Pearson residuals test performed best across all metrics, especially for data with low incidence or count rates and/or sample sizes; however, at the cost of high computational expenses. The parametric Pearson residuals test, which is recommended in many books and guidelines, is faster and performs excellently for GLMs, but can be seriously biased towards underdispersion for GLMMs. We show that the reason for this bias, which increases with the number of random effect clusters/groups, lies in the na\"ive computations of the degrees of freedom for the random effects. The simulation-based response variance test is slightly less powerful than the nonparametric Pearson test, but it showed overall good calibration and is much faster to compute. It offers a compromise between the strengths and weaknesses of the two Pearson-based tests. 4. We conclude that for GLMs, the parametric Pearson residuals test offers the best combination of speed and accuracy. For GLMMs, we recommend either the computationally demanding non-parametric Pearson residuals test or the faster, although somewhat less powerful, simulation-based response variance test.},

  abstract = {Aim: Global forests and their structural and functional features are shaped by many mechanisms that impact tree vital rates. Although many studies have tried to quantify how specific mechanisms influence vital rates, their relative importance among forests remains unclear. We aimed to assess the patterns of variation in vital rates among species and in space and time across forests to understand and provide a baseline for expectations of the relative importance of the different mechanisms in different contexts. Location: 21 forest plots worldwide. Time period: 1981-2021 Major taxa studied: Woody plants Methods: We developed a conceptual and statistical framework (variance partitioning of multilevel models) that attributes the variability in growth, mortality, and recruitment to variation in species, space, and time, and their interactions, which we refer to as organising principles (OPs). We applied it to data from 21 forest plots covering more than 2.9 million trees of approximately 6,500 species. Results: Differences among species, the species OP, were a major source of variability in tree vital rates, explaining 28-33\% of demographic variance alone, and in interaction with space 14-17\%, totalling 40-43\%. Models with small spatial grain sizes (quadrats at 5 x 5 m) retained most of the spatial OP, but a large proportion of variance remained unexplained (31-55\%). The average variability among species declined with species richness across forests, indicating that diverse forests featured smaller interspecific differences in vital rates. Main conclusions: Decomposing variance in vital rates into the proposed OPs showed that taxonomy is crucial to predictions and understanding of tree demography. Our framework has a high potential for identifying the structuring mechanisms of global forest dynamics as it highlights the most promising avenues for future research both in terms of understanding the relative contributions of mechanisms to forest demography and diversity and for improving projections of forest ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation represent a major threat to biodiversity, however, the modulation of its effects by the non-habitat matrix surrounding habitat patches is still undervalued. The landscape matrix might change community assembly in different ways. For example, low-quality matrices can accentuate environmental filtering by reducing resource availability and/or deteriorating abiotic conditions but they may also over limit dispersal of organisms and make communities more prone to ecological drift. To understand how matrix quality modulates the effects of habitat loss, we quantified the relative importance of environmental filter and ecological drift in bird occurrences across both local and landscape gradients of habitat loss embedded in low- and high-quality matrices. We used a trait-based approach to understand habitat loss filtering effects on birds. We found that low-quality matrices, composed mainly of low-productive pasturelands, increased the severity of habitat loss filtering effects for forest specialist birds, but only at the landscape scale. Bird occurrence was in general higher in high-quality matrices, i.e., more heterogeneous and with low-contrasting edges, indicating the role of the matrix quality on attenuating species extinction risks at the landscape scale probably due to mass effect. Moreover, forest specialists presented a strong negative response to habitat loss filtering across different functional traits, while generalists presented a high variability in traits response to habitat loss. We raised evidence in supporting that landscape habitat loss filtering may be relaxed or reinforced depending on the quality of the matrix, evidencing that matrix quality has a strong impact in modulating community assembly processes in fragmented landscapes. In practical terms, it means that improving matrix quality may help in maintaining the high diversity of birds even without any increase in native forest cover.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Ecological and evolutionary processes are recognized as the main factors generating and maintaining biodiversity. However, how biodiversity knowledge is collated, organized, and distributed worldwide influences our perceptions and inferences about biodiversity and the underlying processes. We demonstrated that name-bearing type specimens (NBT), the most fundamental reference for the identity of any species, of all freshwater and brackish fish species in the world are mostly housed in museums in Global North countries. The unequal distribution of NBT results from historical and socioeconomic factors and has implications for both the Global North and South countries. For the Global North, which concentrates most of NBT, we found a mismatch between NBT housed in their ichthyological collections and their native biotas. On the other hand, countries with most NBT of their native species housed elsewhere face a barrier in advancing biodiversity research due to the difficulty in accessing reference material, hampering global efforts in cataloguing, reviewing, and describing new species. We advocate that if we are truly committed to advancing biodiversity research, we should pursue global initiatives to make the distribution of biological knowledge fairer among countries, which involves programs for specimen repatriation and facilitation of accessibility of NBT material to researchers from the countries in which they were collected.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Biological data are often intrinsically hierarchical. Due to their ability to account for such dependencies, mixed-effects models have become a common analysis technique in ecology and evolution. While many questions around their theoretical foundations and practical applications are solved, one fundamental question is still highly debated: When having a low number of levels should we model a grouping variable as a random or fixed effect? In such situation, the variance of the random effect is presumably underestimated, but whether this affects the statistical properties of the ecological effects (fixed effects) is unclear. Here, we analyzed the consequences of including a grouping variable as fixed or random effect and possible other modeling options (too simple or too complex models) for data with small number of levels in the grouping variable (2 - 8). For all models, we calculated type I error rates, power and coverage. Moreover, we show how these statistical properties change with the study design. We found that mixed-effects models already correctly estimate the variance of a random effect with only two groups. Moreover, model choice does not influence the statistical properties of the ecological effect when there is no random slope in the data-generating process. However, if an ecological effect differs among groups, using a random slope and intercept model, and switching to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit, avoids overconfidence in the results. Additionally, power and type I error are strongly influenced by the number of and difference between groups. We conclude that inferring the correct random effect structure is of high importance to get correct statistical properties. When in doubt, we recommend starting with the simpler model and using model diagnostics to identify missing components. When having identified the correct structure, we encourage to start with a mixed-effects model independent of the number of groups and switch to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit. With these recommendations, we allow for more informative choices about study design and data analysis and thus make ecological inference with mixed-effects models more robust for small number of groups.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
